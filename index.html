    <h2>Fork-Purpose</h2>
    <p>You will learn fork in github</p>
    <p>Forking a repository allows you to create a personal copy of someone else's project. This is useful for contributing to open source projects or experimenting with code without affecting the original repository.</p>
    <h3>Steps to Fork a Repository</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the repository you want to fork on GitHub.</li>
        <li>Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the page.</li>
        <li>Select your account or organization where you want to create the fork.</li>
        <li>Once the fork is created, you can clone it to your local machine using `git clone <forked-repo-url>`.</li>
        <li>Make changes, commit them, and push them back to your forked repository.</li>
        <li>If you want to contribute back to the original repository, you can create a pull request from your fork.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Let's say you want to contribute to a project called "awesome-project". You would:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the "awesome-project" repository on GitHub.</li>
        <li>Click the "Fork" button to create a copy in your account.</li>
        <li>Clone your forked repository to your local machine using `git clone</li>
        <li>Make changes to the code, such as fixing a bug or adding a feature.</li>
        <li>Commit your changes with `git commit -m "Fixed a bug"`.</li>    
        <li>Push your changes back to your forked repository using `git push origin main`.</li>
        <li>Go to the original "awesome-project" repository and click on "Pull Requests".</li>
        <li>Click "New Pull Request" and select your forked repository and branch.</li>
        <li>Submit the pull request with a description of your changes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Forking is a powerful feature in GitHub that allows you to work on projects independently while still being able to contribute back to the original project. It encourages collaboration and helps maintain the integrity of the original codebase.</p>
