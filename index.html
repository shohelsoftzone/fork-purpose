    <h2>Fork-Purpose</h2>
    <p>You will learn fork in github</p>
    <p>Forking a repository allows you to create a personal copy of someone else's project. This is useful for contributing to open source projects or experimenting with code without affecting the original repository.</p>
    <h3>Steps to Fork a Repository</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the repository you want to fork on GitHub.</li>
        <li>Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the page.</li>
        <li>Select your account or organization where you want to create the fork.</li>
        <li>Once the fork is created, you can clone it to your local machine using `git clone <forked-repo-url>`.</li>
        <li>Make changes, commit them, and push them back to your forked repository.</li>
        <li>If you want to contribute back to the original repository, you can create a pull request from your fork.</li>
